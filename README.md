# Terraform Provider for Xen Orchestra

This provider was inspired from https://github.com/terra-farm/terraform-provider-xenorchestra.

## Why create another Provider?

I wanted to support more features and make using the provider easier. I didn't want to do a major refactor of the code
to get the features that I wanted right away. My goal end is to eventually merge this code back into the terra-farm 
provider.
